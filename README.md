# Enhancing the Site Project

This is my final project for the Web Design Tools class. It combines Lessons 1, 2, and 3 into one full website.

What’s in the site:

- index.html – The homepage with floated images and sections  
- contact.html – Has a working form that sends to success.html  
- success.html – Confirmation page after submitting the form  
- team.html – Team profiles displayed with centered cards  
- products.html – Basic product grid layout (placeholder for now)

Lesson Requirements Met:

Lesson 1 (Images):  
- 3 full-size images added with thumbnails and descriptions  
- Used <figure> and <figcaption>  
- Added favicon  

Lesson 2 (Forms + Tables):  
- Contact form uses GET and sends to success page  
- Includes proper labels, fieldset, legend, etc.  
- Has a semantic table with headers and scope  

Lesson 3 (Box Model + Floats):  
- Floated images left/right and cleared properly  
- Separate layout.css file used for layout stuff  
- Used box model styles like padding and margins  

Other Notes:

- HTML passed the W3C validator (only has a few harmless info warnings)  
- Site works on different screen sizes  
- Checked with WAVE for accessibility (alt tags, headings, etc.)
